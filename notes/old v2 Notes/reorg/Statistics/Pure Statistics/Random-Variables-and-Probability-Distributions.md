# Random Variables and Probability Distributions

## Definition of Random Variable

<!-- ### Practical Definition
In machine learning, it suffices to think of a random variable simply as a 'variable', or a placeholder for a number or vector. There are notions of probability and randomness associated with it, but these can be associated with other constructs, like probability distributions.

For instance,

$$
y = 2z
$$
Means 'take the value that $$z$$ takes, and multiply it by $$2$$ to get $$y$$. There is no concept of 'randomness' yet introduced. -->

### Precise Definition

A random variable $$X$$ is a function from a sample space $$\Omega$$ to a set of outcomes $$E$$.

For instance, we can assign a random variable to the result of a dice roll, and call it $$X$$. In this case, the sample space is:
$$\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$$

The random variable $$X$$ is a function such that $$X(\omega) = \omega$$, for $$\omega \in \Omega$$.

<!-- It might seem redundant to define a random variable as a function, but it is conceptually useful because functions can take on multiple values depending on their input. If we think of $$X$$ as a function, it is easier to cope with the possibility that $$X$$ may take on more than one value. -->

### Operators on Random Variables
If we assign
$$
Y = 2X
$$

We can think of multiplication by $$2$$ as an operator on the function $$X$$ (An operator takes in a function and provides another function).

We are really saying that $$Y$$ is a new random variable (a new function), $$y \mapsto Y(\omega)$$, such that

$$
Y(\omega) = 2X(\omega) \quad \forall \omega.
$$

If $$X$$ is a random variable representing the value of a dice roll, $$Y$$ is a random variable representing twice the value of a dice roll.

### More notes on notation
#### Capital vs. Lowercase
While random variables are represented with capital letters, we typically use the corresponding lower case letter to denote a realization of that random variable. In math terms, we use $$x$$ to denote $$X(\omega)$$. 

$$
x = X(\omega)
$$

While $$X$$ is a function, $$x$$ is a value.

This is similar to how in mathematicals more generally, if $$f$$ refers to a function, then $$f(x)$$ refers to a value, namely, the output of $$f$$ when its input is $$x$$, although this distinction is [blurred frequently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_notation#Function_notation).

#### Bold vs unbolded
Bolded random variables and their values (realizations) simply indicate that the random variable is vector-valued.



### Sample Spaces in Machine Learning
The sample space is not usually referenced in machine learning. For instance, we might have a latent variable $$\mathbf{Z}$$ in a latent variable model. If $$\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{Z}(\mathbf{w}) \in \mathbb{R}^d$$, the sample space $$\Omega$$ is $$\mathbb{R}^d$$, and we think of $$\mathbf{Z} : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$$ as $$\mathbf{Z}(\omega) = \omega$$.


## Probability Distributions
A probability distribution is a maps random variable ***values*** to densities. Formally, a random variable $$\mathbf{X}$$ is a function with an output domain (often $$\mathbb{R}^d$$), and the probability density function maps the output domain of $$\mathbf{X}$$ to density values in $$\mathbb{R}$$.
$$
p(\mathbf{x}) : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}.
$$

As an exercise in notation, this means we should also be able to write:
$$
p\left(\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{\omega})\right) : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}.
$$

We abbreviate "probability density function" as "PDF".


#### Note
It is not the case that a random variable has a single probability distribution, although we often reference a "true" probability distribution. Rather, a probability distribution is simply a mapping from a random variable's value to a density value.

### Notes on Notation
#### $$Pr(x)$$ vs $$p(x)$$
Typically, $$Pr(A)$$ refers to the probability of event $$A$$, while $$p(x)$$ refers to the value of the PDF at a data point $$x$$. Not everyone uses this notation, though.

#### Resolving function vs. value dilemma
We often use $$f(x)$$ to refer to the function $$f$$, instead of the value of $$f$$ at $$x$$. This is also true in statistics. We commonly use
$$
p(\mathbf{x})
$$

To refer to the probability distribution $$p$$, even though it should denote the density value of the probability distiribution at the point $$\mathbf{x}$$. This is used ubiquitiously, and perhaps the inclusion of $$\mathbf{x}$$ helps specify that the distribution's input are realizations of the random variable $$X$$. Sometimes, this is important because $$p$$ may represent a *family* of distributions, not just a single probability distribution.


#### Families of Probability Distributions
In machine learning, when we write something like $$p_\theta$$, we are typically referring to a *family* of probability distributions, not just a single distribution.

For instance, if we draw $$\mathbf{x_1}, \ldots , \mathbf{x}_N$$ independently from a data distribution, we can write

$$
p_\theta(\mathbf{x_1}, \ldots , \mathbf{x}_N) = \prod_{i=1}^N p_\theta(\mathbf{x_i}).
$$

In this case, the left hand side refers to the probability of observing $$\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots , \mathbf{x}_N$$ according to the joint distribution given by the parameters $$\theta$$. We use $$p_\theta$$ to refer to both the joint *and* marginal distributions. They are intertwined by the rules of probability, e.g., the chain rule.




### Distributions 'over' random variables.
If we write
$$
\mathcal{N}_x(0,I)
$$
The $$x$$ in the subscript indicates that the distribution is "over" the random variable realization $$x$$, as opposed to another random variable. More precisely, $$\mathcal{N}_x(0,I)$$ is function mapping $$x = X(\omega)$$ to $$\mathbb{R}$$. The $$x$$ denotes what we use as the input to this function.

This is useful to disambiguate the input to the PDF when we have several PDFs.

#### Example

Suppose we have 

$$
p(\mathbf{x}) = \int \mathcal{N}_\mathbf{x}(f(\mathbf{z}), I) \cdot N_\mathbf{z}(0,I) d\mathbf{z}.
$$
In this case,


- $$p(\mathbf{x})$$ is a function mapping $$\mathbf{x}$$ to probability values.
- For a given input $$\mathbf{x}$$, we would substitute that value of $$\mathbf{x}$$ into $$\mathcal{N}_\mathbf{x}(f(\mathbf{z}), I)$$ to get a density value.
- The value of $$\mathbf{z}$$ we would use is determined by the integrand.


To evaluate $$p(\mathbf{x})$$ for a specific $$\mathbf{x}$$, we would:
1. Iterate through all values of $$\mathbf{z}$$
2. Plug in $$f(\mathbf{z})$$ for the these values to get the parameters (mean and variance) for the distribution $$\mathcal{N}_\mathbf{x}$$.
3. Plug in $$\mathbf{x}$$ into this distribution to get a probability density value.
4. Plug in $$\mathbf{z}$$ into $$\mathcal{N}_\mathbf{z}(0,I)$$ to get a probability density value
5. Multiply the two density values together (the outputs of the two normal distributions) and accumulate it over all $$\mathbf{z}$$ to evaluate the integral.

The parameters $$f(\mathbf{z}), I$$ are how we describe the function that is the probability distribution.
