## Introduction
<span style="color:blue">To Do: Write Introduction</span>


Diffusion models can be interpreted as Hierarchical VAEs. The encoder in this case has no learnable parameters, and gradually adds noise to data. The decoder attempts to reverse this process.

## DDPM - Noise Schedule
Let $$\mathbf{X}$$ the random variable representing a data sample from the intended distribution, and $$\mathbf{x}$$ be a realization of it. Also, define

$$\mathbf{Z_0} = \mathbf{X}$$

We have latent variables $$\mathbf{z_1}, \ldots, \mathbf{z_T} $$ correponding to noise levels $$1, \ldots, T$$. These latent variables are given by:

$$
\mathbf{z_t} = \sqrt{1 - \beta_t }\mathbf{z_{t-1}} + \sqrt{\beta_t}\mathbf{\epsilon}_t
$$

where $$ \mathbf{\epsilon}_t\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I) $$.

### Marginal Distributions
Computing $$\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x})$$ is like adding a noise level corresponding to $$t$$ to our data. The formulas above allow us to generate these by iteratively adding noise. However, we can actually directly compute the marginal distributions in closed form:

$$
\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x})
$$

(where we are marginalizing over $$\mathbf{z}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{z}_{t-1}$$).

We can do this by working inductively.

To summarize, we define

$$
\alpha_t = \prod_{i=1}^t (1 - \beta_t)
$$

And discover that

$$
\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{\alpha_t} \mathbf{x}, (1-\alpha_t) \mathbf{I})
$$


## DDPM - Derivation of Objective
We would like to maximize the log probability of our data under our generative model. We show we can express an ELBO of our objective as a weighted sum of MSE losses from a sample of $$\mathbf{z}_{t-1} \sim p(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{x})$$ and a prediction of that sample obtained from a learned function on  $$\mathbf{z}_{t}$$. In other words, the objective is to predict $$\mathbf{z}_{t-1}$$ from $$\mathbf{z}_{t}$$, or to denoise the data one step.

This [DDPM Math](DDPM-Math.md) is shown here.

In practice, we express the function $$\mathbf{f}$$ as as a linear combination of $$\mathbf{z}_{t-1}$$ and a noise term $$\mathbf{\epsilon}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})$$.

We use a neural network $$\mathbf{g_\theta}$$ to predict the noise term $$\mathbf{\epsilon}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})$$. This leads to a [reparametrization, and a method of training and inference for DDPMs](DDPM-Reparametrization.md).


## Why Does Diffusion Work?


### Modeling Multi-modal distributions
Generative modeling is about turning simple distributions (noise) into more complex ones (data). 
- The data distribution is very complex and multimodal. But we can assume each denoising step $$ p( \mathbf{z}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{z}_t) $$ is approximately normal.
- VAEs attempt to map $$\mathcal{N}(0,I)$$ to a data distribution with potentially many modes. This is easier to do when each timestep increases the number of modes.
- We sample from a normal distribution at **each reverse time-step**, which eventually allows us to be in a particular 'modes' of the distirbution.
- This eventually allows us to model a multimodal distribution.
- Metaphorically, each sampling step allows you to guides you towards a specific path or another.
- Eventually, you'll fall into one of the modes of the distribution, but due to stochasticity, we hope to see *all* of them

### Plinko
The game [Plinko](https://spribe.co/games/plinko) is a good analogy.

- Higher layers in Plinko are the higher noise levels.
- Instead of each stick outputting 'left' or 'right' with 50/50 probability, the stick steers it in a certain direction.

When we extend this analogy to diffusion when the number of timesteps is infinite, we get something like Brownian Motion.

- If we instead imagine an infinite number of sticks at an infinite number of heights, we have a simulation of Brownian motion or a [Wiener Process](https://masonlwang.com/knowledgemap/notes/concepts/Wiener-Process/).
- The ball moves randomly at *every* time
- The ball become a 'particle' randomly colliding with other particles (but moving down due to gravity, which is like moving forward in time.)


## Notes on Optimization
- We would like our model to predict $$q(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{z}_{t})$$, where $$q$$ is the probability distribution given by the deterministic encoder.
- However, we don't have supervision for this.
- We can compute $$q(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{x})$$.
    - This is a Gaussian whose mean is near $$\mathbf{z}_t$$, but a little further from 0 due to the drift term $$\sqrt{1-\beta_t}$$ applied to the mean of the data during the forward process.

- This guides $$p_\theta(\mathbf{z}_{t-1}, \mathbf{z}_t)$$ toward $$\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim p(\mathbf{x})} q(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{x}) = q(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{x})$$
- It is possible to approximate the expectation term above using Monte-Carlo sampling.
- In other words, we are guiding $$p_\theta(\mathbf{z}_{t-1})$$ with $$q(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{z}_t, \mathbf{x})$$, where samples $$\mathbf{x}$$ are drawn from the data, but since the model cannot see $$\mathbf{x}$$, it will fit $$q(\mathbf{z}_{t-1} \mid \mathbf{z}_{t})$$.


## More Observations
- The diffusion model's predictions are always 'white noise'. When generating audio examples, this probably lends itself to a whole different set of artifacts than say, transpose convolution or a CNN.
- While VAEs model output pixels as conditionally independent given $$z$$, this is NOT true of diffusion models when there are multiple steps. This is because the output pixel at one step has some dependency on the output pixels at intermediate steps.
